## Summary

This study investigates how informal institutional forces, particularly national cultural dimensions like power distance and institutional collectivism, along with the level of corruption, influence earnings management practices across different countries. By analyzing data from 13,341 firms in 26 countries, the research explores both direct and interactive effects of these cultural and corruption variables. Findings reveal that higher power distance and institutional collectivism generally reduce earnings management, whereas corruption positively influences it. Additionally, power distance is found to moderate the influence of corruption on earnings management, while institutional collectivism does not have a similar moderating effect. This study contributes to understanding how informal institutions shape managerial discretion in a global context, providing insights for international business practices and policy formulation.

## Introduction
The introduction discusses the widespread practice of earnings management, where managers use discretion to influence a firm’s reported financial performance, often misleading stakeholders. It highlights the role of national culture, specifically power distance and institutional collectivism, as informal institutions influencing this behavior. Corruption is also presented as an informal institution that can facilitate unethical decision-making. The paper posits that these factors contribute to cross-national differences in earnings management. By examining these dimensions, the study aims to fill a gap in the literature regarding how culture and corruption interact to influence earnings management, especially in developing economies where formal regulatory frameworks may be weaker. The study uses institutional theory to explore the motivations behind earnings management practices in a global context.

## Literature Review
The authors draw upon several streams of literature to support their hypotheses and situate their study within the broader research landscape on earnings management, national culture, and corruption. Key references include:

1. **Earnings Management**: Prior studies, such as Healy and Wahlen (1999) and Dechow and Skinner (2000), define earnings management as the use of managerial discretion to influence reported financial performance, often with the intention of misleading stakeholders. The paper also references Klein (2002), who explores how managerial discretion in earnings reporting can distort financial performance by manipulating accruals and other financial items.

2. **Institutional Theory**: The authors use institutional theory, particularly North (1990) and Zucker (1983), to argue that common understandings within a national context serve as informal institutions guiding managerial behavior. They build on the idea that culture provides motivation and justification for behaviors aligned with national values, as discussed by Deephouse et al. (2016) and Licht et al. (2007).

3. **National Culture and Accounting Practices**: The foundational work of Gray (1988) proposes that national culture imprints on accounting practices, influencing choices such as earnings management. Studies by Doupnik (2008), Han et al. (2010), and Guan et al. (2005) support Gray's framework by showing how cultural dimensions like individualism correlate with earnings management. The authors highlight a gap in previous literature, noting that while individualism has been extensively studied, power distance has received less attention.

4. **Power Distance and Collectivism**: Hofstede (2001) and the GLOBE study by House et al. (2004) provide the basis for examining power distance and collectivism. Prior research (e.g., Parboteeah et al., 2005; Thorne & Sauders, 2002) shows that high power distance cultures tend to limit managerial discretion due to respect for authority and adherence to hierarchical norms, which may reduce earnings management.

5. **Corruption**: Research on corruption as an informal institution suggests it facilitates unethical behaviors in business, as discussed by Eden and Miller (2004) and Judge et al. (2008). The study refers to works like Doh et al. (2003) to illustrate that pervasive corruption creates environments where unethical behavior is less stigmatized, potentially increasing earnings management. The interaction between culture and corruption in shaping managerial practices has been relatively unexplored, which this paper aims to address.

## Institutional Background
The **Institutional Background** section draws on institutional theory to explore how informal institutions (such as culture and corruption) at the national level affect managerial decision-making. Institutional theory suggests that managers' decisions are shaped by commonly understood norms of “appropriate behavior” within their environment. Power distance and institutional collectivism are seen as cultural dimensions influencing earnings management under varying behavioral norms. Corruption is characterized as an informal institution that encourages self-interested behavior at the expense of others and is considered a significant factor in everyday economic and social life in certain countries. The study proposes that these informal institutions significantly influence perceptions of the legitimacy of earnings management, especially where formal regulatory frameworks are weak.

## Hypotheses

1. **Hypothesis 1**: Power distance is negatively related to the magnitude of earnings management. In high power distance cultures, managers are more likely to adhere to authority, making them less likely to engage in earnings management.
   
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Institutional collectivism is negatively related to the magnitude of earnings management. In highly collectivist societies, managers prioritize group interests, leading them to follow financial reporting standards more closely.
   
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Corruption pervasiveness is positively related to the magnitude of earnings management. In more corrupt environments, managers are more inclined to engage in earnings management to pursue self-interest.
   
4. **Hypothesis 4**: Power distance weakens the positive relationship between corruption pervasiveness and the magnitude of earnings management. In high power distance cultures, managers are more likely to follow rules, even in corrupt environments, reducing deviations from norms.
   
5. **Hypothesis 5**: Institutional collectivism weakens the positive relationship between corruption pervasiveness and the magnitude of earnings management. In highly collectivist cultures, managers are more focused on group welfare, making the influence of corruption on earnings management less significant.

## Research Design
### Data and Sample
The sample consists of 13,341 firms across 26 countries, including both developed and developing economies. Firm-level data were obtained from Bloomberg Terminal, cultural variables were sourced from the GLOBE project, and country-level corruption and regulatory quality data were taken from the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) database.

### Dependent Variable
The dependent variable, **Earnings Management**, is measured by discretionary accruals, calculated using a modified Jones model. The absolute value of discretionary accruals is used as a proxy for the magnitude of earnings management, focusing on the extent rather than the direction of accrual adjustments.

### Explanatory Variables
1. **Power Distance**: Measured using the GLOBE project’s "as is" scores, reflecting actual practices within a country regarding hierarchical relationships.
2. **Institutional Collectivism**: Also measured using GLOBE "as is" scores, representing the degree to which societal practices encourage collective resource distribution and action.
3. **Corruption Pervasiveness**: Sourced from the WGI database's "control of corruption" indicator, reverse-scored to indicate higher levels of corruption.

### Regression Equation
The modified Jones model for discretionary accruals is specified as follows:

$$
\frac{TACC_t}{TA_{t-1}} = a_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{TA_{t-1}}\right) + a_1 \cdot \left(\frac{\Delta \text{Revenue}_t}{TA_{t-1}}\right) + a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{GPPE_t}{TA_{t-1}}\right) + a_3 \cdot \left(\frac{ROA_t}{TA_{t-1}}\right) + e_t
$$

Where:
- $TACC_t$ is total accruals at time $t$,
- $\Delta \text{Revenue}_t$ is the change in revenue at time $t$,
- $GPPE_t$ represents gross property, plant, and equipment,
- $ROA_t$ is the return on assets,
- $TA_{t-1}$ is the lagged total assets.

## Empirical Results

1. **Relationship between Power Distance and Earnings Management**: Supporting Hypothesis 1, power distance is negatively related to earnings management, indicating that high power distance cultures are associated with lower earnings management.
   
2. **Relationship between Institutional Collectivism and Earnings Management**: Supporting Hypothesis 2, institutional collectivism is negatively related to earnings management, suggesting that managers in collectivist societies are more likely to adhere to financial reporting standards.
   
3. **Impact of Corruption on Earnings Management**: Supporting Hypothesis 3, corruption pervasiveness is positively related to earnings management, meaning firms in highly corrupt countries are more likely to engage in earnings management.
   
4. **Moderating Effect of Power Distance on Corruption**: Supporting Hypothesis 4, power distance moderates the positive effect of corruption on earnings management, reducing its impact in high power distance contexts.
   
5. **Moderating Effect of Institutional Collectivism**: Hypothesis 5 is not supported; institutional collectivism does not significantly moderate the relationship between corruption and earnings management.

## Limitations and Future Research
The authors acknowledge several limitations. First, the study focuses on specific cultural dimensions—power distance and institutional collectivism—which are derived from Gray’s (1988) model. Other cultural dimensions, such as performance orientation or humane orientation from the GLOBE framework, might also impact earnings management and could be explored in future research. Additionally, the sample includes only certain countries, excluding some with relevant cultural traits, such as Japan and South Korea. Including these countries in future studies may provide further insights.

Another limitation is the exclusive use of discretionary accruals as the measure of earnings management. Future research could incorporate alternative measures, such as real activities manipulation or other earnings management methods, to offer a more comprehensive view. Lastly, while this study used secondary data, primary data from surveys or interviews could provide deeper insights into managerial motivations and ethical standards across different institutional contexts.
