## Summary

This study explores the effect of auditor size on accounting fraud in China, focusing on a setting characterized by significant government sanctions and minimal litigation risks. It finds that larger audit firms are less likely to oversee financial statement fraud, especially in regulated industries and in cases of revenue-related frauds. The findings emphasize the critical role of government sanctions in maintaining audit quality in China, a stark contrast to the litigation-driven mechanisms in Western economies.

## Introduction
China's rapid economic growth and unique regulatory environment offer both challenges and opportunities for auditors. The paper underscores the necessity of understanding local nuances, particularly how government interventions influence accounting practices and auditor responsibilities.

## Institutional Background and Literature Review
### Literature Context
- **Litigation Risk vs. Government Sanctions:** Studies like Francis & Krishnan (1999) and Lennox & Pittman (2010) have shown that in jurisdictions with high litigation risks, larger audit firms provide higher quality audits. However, in settings with lower legal protections like China, the impact of auditor size on audit quality is less clear, with studies such as Hope & Langli (2010) and Jeong & Rho (2004) finding no significant differences.
- **Role of Government in Audit Quality:** The Chinese government's role through severe sanctions for audit failures enhances audit quality effectively, substituting for the deterrent effect typically provided by litigation in the West, as supported by Firth, Mo, & Wong (2005).

### Implications of Auditor Size in China

- The unique characteristics of China's market suggest that large auditors might have stronger incentives to avoid government sanctions, potentially leading to higher audit quality.

## Hypothesis

The study posits that larger audit firms, due to their prominence and higher stakes, are less likely to engage in or overlook financial statement fraud. This hypothesis contrasts environments with significant litigation risks against Chinaâ€™s reliance on governmental oversight and sanctions.

## Research Design
### Model
The primary analysis uses a probit model to test the probability of financial statement fraud based on auditor size and other controls. The regression model used is:
$$
\text{Fraud}_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(\text{AuditorSize}_{i,t}) + \beta_2 \text{AuditorTenure}_{i,t} + \cdots + \beta_9 \text{Book-to-Market}_{i,t} + \beta_{10} \text{Loss}_{i,t-1} + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$

### Variables Defined
- $\text{Fraudi,t}$: Binary indicator of fraud for firm i in year t.
- $\ln(\text{AuditorSize}_{i,t})$: Logarithm of the total client assets managed by the auditor.
- Control variables include factors like auditor tenure, company age, and financial ratios.

## Empirical Results
The findings confirm that larger auditors significantly reduce the likelihood of financial statement fraud. This effect is pronounced in regulated industries and in cases involving revenue-related frauds. Additionally, the effectiveness of government sanctions serves as a viable substitute for litigation in ensuring audit quality.
