## Summary

This paper investigates how external auditors assess fraud risk in family versus non-family firms, focusing on the role of audit committee (AC) strength as a moderating factor. Through an experiment involving highly experienced auditors, the study finds that auditors perceive family firms as having a higher fraud risk than non-family firms, aligning with **entrenchment theory**. This theory suggests that family members may exploit control for personal gain, increasing the risk of fraudulent behavior. Additionally, weak ACs in family firms amplify this perceived risk, making auditors less likely to accept these firms as clients. These findings indicate that auditors see more severe agency conflicts in family firms, particularly when governance structures are weak.

## Introduction
The study addresses the intersection of family business research and business ethics by examining whether auditors perceive higher fraud risks in family firms compared to non-family firms. Family firms play a critical role in the economy, and there is ongoing debate about their ethical standards relative to non-family firms. This paper aims to fill a research gap by exploring whether auditors, who prioritize risk in their assessments, view family firms as maintaining stronger ethical standards or facing unique threats that increase fraud potential.

## Institutional Background
Family firms are defined as companies where founding family members hold significant control, often as key shareholders or executives. Such firms comprise a large portion of the S&P 500. Two prominent theories—entrenchment theory and alignment theory—address agency issues in family firms:

- **Entrenchment Theory**: This theory suggests that family members in leadership roles may exploit firm resources, prioritizing personal gain over minority shareholders’ interests. Research by Anderson and Reeb (2004), Demsetz and Lehn (1985), and Shleifer and Vishny (1997) discusses how concentrated ownership allows this kind of opportunistic behavior. The socioemotional wealth (SEW) concept by Berrone et al. (2012) and Gomez-Mejia et al. (2007) extends this view, proposing that family firms prioritize family interests, potentially increasing fraud risk.
  
- **Alignment Theory**: This perspective argues that family ownership aligns management and shareholder interests, leading to reduced agency conflicts and higher ethical standards. Ali et al. (2007), Wang (2006), and Srinidhi et al. (2014) suggest that family firms have higher earnings quality, theoretically resulting in a lower fraud risk.

### Related Empirical Studies
Studies by Ghosh and Tang (2015) and Srinidhi and Liao (2014) analyze archival data to assess auditor fees and client acceptance in family versus non-family firms, with mixed results. While some findings suggest lower audit fees in family firms, others indicate that weakly governed family firms pay less, challenging assumptions of superior reporting quality in family firms. These studies do not, however, provide direct evidence on auditors' ex ante fraud risk assessments, a gap this paper seeks to address.

## Hypotheses
The study proposes two hypotheses based on the competing predictions of entrenchment theory and alignment theory:

- **Hypothesis 1**: Auditors will assess a higher risk of fraud in family firms than in non-family firms, consistent with entrenchment theory.
- **Hypothesis 2**: AC strength moderates the family-firm effect on fraud risk assessment. Specifically, auditors will assess the highest fraud risk in family firms with weak ACs and be least likely to accept them as clients.

## Research Design
The experimental design involved 60 auditors from Big 4 and other major firms. Participants assessed fraud risk and client acceptance for hypothetical firms, with family firm status and AC strength as the manipulated variables.

### Regression Models
Two primary models were used to test the effects of family firm status, AC strength, and their interaction on fraud risk assessment and client acceptance.

1. **Fraud Risk Assessment Model**:
   $$
   FraudRisk_{ij} = \alpha + \beta_1 FamilyFirm_{i} + \beta_2 ACStrength_{j} + \beta_3 (FamilyFirm \times ACStrength)_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}
   $$
   - $FamilyFirm$ is a binary indicator (1 = family firm, 0 = non-family firm).
   - $ACStrength$ is a binary indicator for AC strength (1 = strong, 0 = weak).
   - The interaction term $FamilyFirm \times ACStrength$ captures the moderating effect of AC strength.

2. **Client Acceptance Model**:
   $$
   ClientAcceptance_{ij} = \alpha + \gamma_1 FamilyFirm_{i} + \gamma_2 ACStrength_{j} + \gamma_3 (FamilyFirm \times ACStrength)_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}
   $$

   This model examines how family firm status and AC strength influence the likelihood of client acceptance.

### Variable Definitions
- **FamilyFirm**: A binary indicator representing family control.
- **ACStrength**: A binary indicator for the strength of the audit committee.
- **FraudRisk**: A score from 1 to 11, measuring the perceived risk of financial statement misstatement.
- **ClientAcceptance**: Likelihood of accepting the firm as a client, rated from 1 to 11.

### Robustness Checks

1. **Control and Inherent Risk Assessments**: These additional assessments measured the firm’s internal control risk and inherent risk, both significant predictors of overall fraud risk, confirming the model's robustness.
   
2. **Ordinal Interaction Testing**: Planned contrasts were applied to test ordinal interactions between family firm status and AC strength, consistent with Guggenmos et al. (2016). The results supported the entrenchment theory pattern, with residual variance tests validating the ordinal contrasts.

3. **Alternative Weight Testing**: The study also tested different contrast weights and orthogonal contrasts, which produced similar significant results, ensuring the model's resilience to alternative settings.

## Empirical Results

1. **Higher Fraud Risk in Family Firms**: Auditors assess family firms as having a higher risk of fraud than non-family firms.
2. **AC Strength Moderation**: Fraud risk assessments are highest, and client acceptance lowest, in family firms with weak ACs.
3. **Client Acceptance Decisions**: Auditors are less likely to recommend family firms as clients, especially those with weak ACs, suggesting perceived agency conflicts are more pronounced in family-controlled firms with weaker governance.
