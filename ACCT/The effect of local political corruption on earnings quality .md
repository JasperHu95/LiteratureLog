## Summary

The study examines the impact of local political corruption on earnings quality, focusing on whether political corruption at the judicial district level influences earnings management activities of firms located in corrupt areas. Using a sample of publicly listed U.S. firms from 2007 to 2014, the authors find that firms in corrupt regions are more likely to engage in earnings management through accruals management and real activities manipulation, such as sales manipulation and overproduction. Additionally, firms in corrupt areas are found to have less earnings persistence and are more likely to use positive discretionary accruals to meet or beat consensus analysts’ earnings forecasts. The study contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the influence of local political corruption on firms’ earnings quality.

## Introduction

Political corruption is a significant social problem that impedes economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted the broader corrosive impact of corruption on society, undermining trust in government and eroding ethical standards. The literature presents two competing theories on the efficiency of political corruption: one suggesting that corruption is efficient as it allows firms to bypass bureaucratic rules, and the other arguing that corruption is inefficient, acting as a harmful form of taxation that discourages useful investments and innovation. This study explores the effect of local political corruption on firms’ earnings management activities to provide insights into these competing theories.

## Institutional Background

Political corruption is defined as the inappropriate exploitation of bureaucratic officials' powers for personal gain. Prior research has explored the determinants and consequences of political corruption, focusing on factors such as socio-demographic and cultural influences, government size, legal system effectiveness, economic competition, and political institutions. The economic consequences of political corruption include slower economic growth, less efficient economic policies, lower levels of investment, increased business costs, higher living costs, increased inequality and poverty, and reduced levels of innovation and entrepreneurship. Recent studies have also shown that firms in corrupt regions are more likely to pay higher audit fees, have longer audit report lags, and have a higher probability of receiving a going concern audit opinion.

## Hypothesis

### Literature Review

The literature on political corruption is divided into two main strands: determinants of political corruption and consequences of political corruption. Determinants include socio-demographic and cultural factors, government size, legal system effectiveness, economic competition, and political institutions. Consequences include slower economic growth, less efficient economic policies, lower levels of investment, increased business costs, higher living costs, increased inequality and poverty, and reduced levels of innovation and entrepreneurship.

### Hypothesis Development

1. **Political Corruption and Accrual-Based Earnings Management**
   - **H1**: There is a positive association between political corruption and accrual-based earnings management.
   - **H1a**: Political corruption is positively related to income-increasing discretionary accruals.
   - **H1b**: Political corruption is positively related to income-decreasing discretionary accruals.

2. **Political Corruption and Real Earnings Management**
   - **H2**: There is a positive association between political corruption and real earnings management.

## Research Design

### Regression Equations

The study employs the following model to measure the effect of political corruption on accrual-based earnings management (AM) and real earnings management (RAM):

$$ EM = β0 + β1COR\_PER\_CAPIT + β2ROA + β3MTB + β4LOSS + β5LVRG + β6SIZE + β7HIGHGROWTH + β8HILITIG + β9HIGHTECH + β10EXTRAOD + β11ZSCORE + β12MNA + β13GROWTH + β14FRGN + β15SEG + β16PUBLIC\_EXCHNG + β17RELIGIOSITY + β18RURAL + β19LNPOP + YEAR\_INDICATORS + IND\_INDICATORS + ε $$

### Robustness Tests

The study includes robustness tests such as two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression, propensity score matching, and the addition of audit-related variables to control for potential endogeneity problems.

## Empirical Results

1. **Political Corruption and Accrual-Based Earnings Management**
   - The results show a positive association between political corruption and the absolute value of discretionary accruals, income-increasing discretionary accruals, and income-decreasing discretionary accruals.

2. **Political Corruption and Real Earnings Management**
   - The results indicate a positive association between political corruption and the abnormal level of discretionary expenditures, a negative association with the abnormal level of cash flow from operations, and a positive association with the abnormal level of production costs.

### Additional Analyses

1. **Earnings Persistence**
   - The study finds that political corruption results in less persistent earnings for firms.

2. **Meeting or Beating Earnings Target**
   - Firms in corrupt areas are more likely to use income-increasing discretionary accruals to meet or beat consensus analysts’ earnings forecasts.
