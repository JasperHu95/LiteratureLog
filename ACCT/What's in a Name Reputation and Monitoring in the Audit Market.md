# What's in a Name? Reputation and Monitoring in the Audit Market

## Summary
The paper investigates the impact of a rule change in the audit industry in the USA, which mandates the disclosure of the engagement partner's name on audit reports. The authors analyze how this transparency affects auditing by potentially altering the incentives for reputation building and monitoring among audit partners. The study uses a theoretical model to predict that while transparency can enhance individual reputational incentives, it may also reduce collective monitoring efforts, leading to mixed effects on audit quality.

## Introduction

Before the 2017 rule change, the identity of audit partners was not disclosed in audit reports. The new requirement by the PCAOB, approved by the SEC, aimed to increase transparency and accountability in financial reporting. The paper posits that increased transparency changes the dynamics of reputation and monitoring within audit firms, potentially affecting audit quality in unforeseen ways.

## Institutional Background

The rule change studied in this paper reflects a broader regulatory shift toward transparency in financial markets. Specifically, it addresses the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)'s implementation of a requirement for audit reports to disclose the names of the lead audit partners involved in preparing the audits of publicly traded companies in the United States, which went into effect in February 2017.

## Hypothesis

The paper hypothesizes that disclosing audit partners' names increases the individual reputational incentives of the auditors, which could lead to higher audit quality. However, it also suggests that this transparency might undermine the collective monitoring mechanisms within firms, potentially leading to lower audit quality if the negative monitoring effects outweigh the positive reputation effects. These hypotheses are framed within the context of existing literature that discusses the impacts of transparency and individual accountability on professional behavior and organizational outcomes.

## Literature Review
The study engages with two primary strands of literature: effects of transparency in audit markets and collective versus individual reputational effects within firms. Prior research like Carcello and Li (2013) documented that disclosure in the UK increased audit quality and fees, suggesting enhanced accountability. However, Blay et al. (2014) find no significant improvement in the Netherlands, indicating mixed effects. Theoretical frameworks from Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) and Kreps et al. (1982) also inform the analysis, discussing how visibility of individual actions can shift focus from group to individual outcomes.

## Research Design

### Regression

$$
AuditQuality_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Disclosure_{it} + \beta_2 \cdot Reputation_{it} + \beta_3 \cdot Monitoring_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$
Where:
- $AuditQuality_{it}$ is the quality of the audit.
- $Disclosure_{it}$ indicates if the partnerâ€™s name is disclosed.
- $Reputation_{it}$ measures the reputational capital.
- $Monitoring_{it}$ captures the extent of monitoring.
- $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.

## Empirical Results
The empirical analysis suggests that transparency in disclosing audit partners' names enhances individual reputational incentives but reduces incentives for collective monitoring. This dual effect complicates the interpretation of transparency measures, indicating that the net impact on audit quality varies depending on the specific implementation of disclosure rules.
