# LiteratureLog

## Introduction of the LiteratureLog

It is my personal LiteratureLog.



My research interests primarily focus on accounting, hence, accounting literature will be the main content of this LiteratureLog. Additionally, economics is a field that greatly interests me as well, because economic literature often inspires insights in management research. Therefore, this LiteratureLog will also include papers from the economics.



I will disassemble the literature I have read into reading notes. On one hand, this serves as a personal record of my literature review, and on the other hand, I hope that one day someone might discover this GitHub repository, and I aspire for my modest work to be shared with those in need through an open-source approach.
