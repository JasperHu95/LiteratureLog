# LiteratureLog

It is my personal LiteratureLog.

My research interests primarily focus on accounting, hence, accounting literature will be the main content of this LiteratureLog. Additionally, economics is a field that greatly interests me as well, because economic literature often inspires insights in management research. Therefore, this LiteratureLog will also include papers from the economics.
