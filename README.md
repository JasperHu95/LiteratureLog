# LiteratureLog

## Introduction of the LiteratureLog

It is my personal LiteratureLog.

My research interests focus on accounting, hence, accounting literature will be the main content of this LiteratureLog. Additionally, economics is a field that greatly interests me as well, because economic literature often inspires insights in management research. Therefore, this LiteratureLog will also include papers from the economics.

My primary research interests are primarily focused on empirical studies, so econometrics and methodology are also areas I pay attention to. Of course, I am not particularly interested in these theories themselves, as research in the field of econometrics requires a strong foundation in mathematics, which is not my strong suit. However, I believe we still need to pay attention to these methods, as they can help us achieve results in future research that were previously unattainable.



I will disassemble the literature I have read into reading notes. On one hand, this serves as a personal record of my literature review, and on the other hand, I hope that one day someone might discover this GitHub repository, and I aspire for my work to be shared with those in need through an open-source approach.
