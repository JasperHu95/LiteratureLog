## Introduction of the LiteratureLog

It is my personal LiteratureLog.



My research interests primarily focus on accounting, hence, accounting literature will be the main content of this LiteratureLog. Additionally, economics is a field that greatly interests me as well, because economic literature often inspires insights in management research. Therefore, this LiteratureLog will also include papers from the economics.



I will disassemble the literature I have read into reading notes. On one hand, this serves as a personal record of my literature review, and on the other hand, I hope that one day someone might discover this GitHub repository, and I aspire for my modest work to be shared with those in need through an open-source approach.

**Abstract:**

Local governments play dual, but conflicting, roles in China's tax system. That is, they are both tax collectors and controlling shareholders of firms subject to tax payments. We investigate how local governments balance their tax collection and tax avoidance incentives. We find that the conflicts between central and local governments arising from the 2002 tax sharing reform have led to more tax avoidance by local government-controlled firms, particularly when the local government's ownership percentage of the firms is higher than the tax sharing ratio. We also find evidence that the overall level of tax avoidance by local government-controlled firms in a region is positively associated with local fiscal deficits. As a high level of government ownership of corporations and intergovernmental tax sharing are common phenomena in many transitional economies, this study offers valuable insights into how the dual roles played by local governments affect tax policy enforcement in these economies.
